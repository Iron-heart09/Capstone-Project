            <p>
                The concept of A.I. goes as far back as Greek antiquity.Alan Turing, British mathematician and WWII code-breaker is
                widely credited as being one of the first people to come up with 
                the idea of macines that think. <a href="./img/Alan Turing at 100.jpg">Click here to see an image of Alan Turing</a>

                <h3>How Does A.I. Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    A.I. works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, 
                    allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data.
